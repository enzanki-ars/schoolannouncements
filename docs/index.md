## Usage/Editing

Editing a site like this is a little different than most people would expect.
Instead of manually going through the code and finding the various items that
need to be changed, you simply have to look at the files in the `_data`
directory. The rest of this page provides examples representing every possible
field that can be used in the file. In the examples below, many of these fields
are optional. If you do not require that field, just skip adding that line.

Look at the existing files in [this project's repository code]({{ site.github.repository_url }})
for some examples.

**Some important notes:**

* `.yml` files can be a little annoying at times. Indentation can _only_ be done
using spaces.

* While not required, when a line is longer than 80 characters,
usually used in descriptions, consider using the `>` character as shown below.
This helps everybody so they do not have to scroll left and right to read the
data file.

```yml
description: >
  Really long text goes here...
  It can even span multiple lines!

  If you need a separate paragraph, separate them with a blank line.
```

* Anything that starts with a dash (`-`) can be repeated over and over and over...
It is a list, where each item start with that dash.

* In some cases, you might see text like `[...]`. This represents an array.
In a yml list, each item is separated with a comma.
Example: `["Something", "Something Else", "Unknown something"]`

* All description like fields accept
[markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/).
Markdown includes features such as bold, italics, lists, and more. Feel free to
use any markdown you wish.

* `date:` should be input in the form `YEAR-MONTH-DAY HOUR:MINUTESam/pm`.
Example: `2016-07-21 1:00pm`

* `color:` can be any color you wish to use for the background of the slide.
You can use any [named colors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_colors#X11_color_names),
or you can use a [hex triplet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_colors#Hex_triplet).
